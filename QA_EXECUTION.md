# QA Execution Documentation — Github

## QA objective
Validate repository integrity, application structure, build/test configuration, functional behavior, negative/error handling, security-sensitive configuration, and deployment readiness.

## Execution record
1. Repository structure and source files inspected.
2. Build/dependency configuration reviewed.
3. Existing tests and GitHub Actions reviewed where present.
4. Functional and negative test scenarios defined for available application behavior.
5. Security-sensitive patterns and configuration reviewed.
6. Deployment/runtime configuration reviewed where present.

## Evidence rules
- **Executed:** supported by a test runner, build, CI job, or reproducible runtime check.
- **Inspected:** supported by source/configuration inspection only.
- **Blocked:** execution requires missing application code, dependencies, credentials, services, or environment configuration.
- No defect is invented from missing functionality.

## Defect handling
Confirmed defects must have direct evidence and are fixed only when the intended behavior can be established from the repository.

## Final status
**QA execution documented.** The repository remains subject to the evidence-based execution limits above.
